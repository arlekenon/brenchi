Does every active task create a field every day?  During active actions with the branch, the verka rises upward.  You can see it in pictures and it increases as you observe.

Managing one project or managing multiple projects?

Each field represents some stage of the branch at a given time.

Stimulates the updating of important branches, so as not to return to the past branches?

For each branch, every day (you can select days in which it will not be created, (weekends)) a field will be created, if there is no action on the branch, then there is an option (button) to skip and the skip will be counted.  You can create a condition under which several omissions in a row will mean that the branch will be considered asleep.

Nesting levels - (obsolete “Each field can be activated by clicking”), the second nesting level will open. Nesting levels up to a certain amount are indicated by an indication on the field, as well as on the side of the open level.

The level opens when you hover over its indication, when you move away it disappears accordingly, when you click you can 
select the option or fix the opening of the level.  When inserting, a level is automatically created for the full text if it is text, a level is created for the image if it is an image.
